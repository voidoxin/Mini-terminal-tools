# 🖥️ Mini Terminal Tools - by Voidoxin

Welcome to **Mini Terminal Tools**, a beginner-friendly **C++ console program** created for learning and practice purposes.  
This project runs directly in the terminal and currently includes:

- 🧮 **Calculator** – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- 🌡️ **Temperature Converter** – Convert between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K)  
- 🧠 **Quiz** – Test your knowledge with multiple-choice questions
