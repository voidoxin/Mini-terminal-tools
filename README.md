# 🖥️ Mini Terminal Tools - by Voidoxin

Welcome to **Mini Terminal Tools**, a beginner-friendly **C++ console program** created for learning and practice purposes.  
This project runs directly in the terminal and currently includes two basic tools:  

- 🧮 **Calculator** – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- 🌡️ **Temperature Converter** – Convert between Celsius (C), Fahrenheit (F), and Kelvin (K).

## 📌 Overview

This is my first C++ project, designed to practice fundamental programming concepts:

- Input and output operations (`cin`, `cout`)  
- Basic arithmetic and conditional logic  
- Using `switch` statements for control flow  
- Organizing code into reusable **functions**  

This project is still **basic and educational**, and I plan to **add more useful tools** and improve features in the near future.
